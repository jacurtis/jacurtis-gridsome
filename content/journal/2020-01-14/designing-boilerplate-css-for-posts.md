Today, while working towards getting this site up and running in its' primative form, I ran into the need to create some basic styling for my new website. My goal is to keep the styling pretty minimal at the moment.

So I wished I had a nice list of each element I should style. Instead of pulling in a fancy CSS Framework (that everyone is doing nowadays), I decided to practice 

```html
<body> <!-- Mainly used for scoping -->
<ul> 
<ol>
<quote>

```
